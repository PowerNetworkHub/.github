## Announcement
Hello PowerNetwork Community,

I am writing to address the support for my plugins.

For those who have been supporting me, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude. Your support means the world to me, and I assure you that nothing will change for you.

I've been dedicated to developing Minecraft server plugins since 2011, with my main project, PowerRanks, kicking off in 2014. Over the past decade, I've poured countless hours into creating these Open-Source tools that empower servers worldwide, all without charge.

However, I've noticed that over 99% of servers running my plugins aren't contributing to their ongoing development. While this is par for the course with free software, I've no intention of putting up paywalls to access them. That being said, the demand for support, even for basic questions, has increased substantially, and this requires a significant investment of my time.

I genuinely cherish the time I spend on plugin development, but being a student means I can't provide the same level of attention to everyone. This has left me feeling a bit burnt out after all these years.
To adapt, I'm implementing the following changes:

* If you're seeking support on Discord, I kindly request that you consider sponsorship. It's standard practice for companies providing software not to offer support for free. While I'll still offer occasional free support when possible, if you come across something not covered in the Wiki, let me know, and I'll update it.

* The Discord support channel will be divided into community support and donator support.

* If you're not sponsoring me, please understand that you may not receive immediate assistance, and I'd appreciate it if you refrained from making feature requests. I already have many plans in motion.
Supporters will not only receive assistance with PowerPlugins but also guidance on integration into their server. For instance, if PowerRanks doesn't seamlessly work with another plugin, I can recreate the scenario and guide you on getting it up and running.
